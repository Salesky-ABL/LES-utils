# Name: process.yaml
# Author: Brian R. Greene
# University of Oklahoma
# Created: 31 March 2023
# Purpose: process output from LES using functions from LESutils
# for use with process.py
# Updated: 6 September 2023
# Use updated process_raw_sim function that uses new LES output so not
# necessary to hardcode parameters here. Focus primarily on: out2netcdf,
# calc_stats, nc_rotate, and (soon) timeseries2netcdf
# Updated: 6 October 2023
# Added support for timeseries2netcdf and a new organize_output for use
# with batch jobs on supercomputers with multiple successive runs
